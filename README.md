 *I'd like to preface with the fact that my github and programming journey is still **very** much in it's infancy. please bear with me.*

- Hello there, all who view this! My screen name is Eribloot, although on some other platforms I am on it will be Eriblazer.

- If you haven't checked out my general bio on my profile, I'm interested in cooking, coffee brewing, and programming to name a few things.
    I've retained a bit about a few of the languages I've studied from my time in college, primarily Java and C++!

- Right now, I'm not quite sure what I'd like to study to work with professionally, in all honesty. Everyone has to start somewhere-- so for now, I'm focusing on web development!
    
- You can reach me by email if you would like to reach out about anything! Seriously, anything. We can talk about the difference between
    whole coffee beans and pre-ground beans. 
    
    Thanks for reading, and lets see where this goes!
