 *I'd like to preface with the fact that my github and programming journey is still **very** much in it's infancy. please bear with me.*

- Hello there, all who view this! My screen name is Eribloot, although on some other platforms I am on it will be Eriblazer.

- If you haven't checked out my general bio on my profile, I'm interested in cooking, coffee brewing, and programming to name a few things.
    I've retained a bit about a few of the languages I've studied from my time in college, primarily Java and C++!

- Right now, I'm not quite sure what I'd like to study to work with professionally, in all honesty. Everyone has to start somewhere-- so for now, I'm focusing on web development!
    Currently, I'm working on understanding and learning up on HTML5 and CSS to start, and slowly working my way towards other languages; following that with studying up on Security.
    
- The main project I will be dedicating much of my time to is my website that I will be writing from the ground up! I'll update this as time goes by, and I'm sure this
    Readme will drastically change as time passes too.
    
- For now-- if somehow you ended up on my page or in one of my projects, shoot me a message; because this will probably need updating by then.

- Speaking of which... you can reach me by email if you would like to reach out about anything! Seriously, anything. We can talk about the difference between
    whole coffee beans and pre-ground beans. 
    
    
    Thanks for reading!
